EdsACPlugin
-----------

I am purely exploring AC plugin writing for fun.  I have no goals with this project other than to scratch my own itches in Asheron's Call.

A word of caution:  I have absolutely *no* idea what I'm doing while writing this.  Use at your own peril.  If it destroys all your items, or salvages all your gear... well... Don't say I didn't warn you!

Why?
----

I was using the Alinco3 plugin, but found it to be lacking in updates.  The Virindi plugins are very nice, but don't loot the way I like, and
require the macro to be running for things other than simple looting.  I'm sure there are ways to make the Virindi system work the way I want,
but I also want to explore plugin authoring myself!

What Does It Do?
----------------

At the moment:  Absolutely *nothing*.  This is partially because (as I'm writing this) the Turbine Asheron's Call servers are being moved to a new data center.  Hopefully the game will be up by Friday
this week, which will allow me to do something useful and productive then!  :)

Until then, I have a lot of research to do about items and IDs and how to obtain them!
